//There is a FoundObjects enum containing 6 values:
//Mundane, Bucket_Spade, Holograms, Glasses, Model, Disk
//Mundane is for any object that there is no puzzle for. 
//We can decide if we want to do handle all mundane objects a certain way. 
//ie. displaying filler text "This is a vase, it looks useless." - but probably as a 'if we have time' type thing
